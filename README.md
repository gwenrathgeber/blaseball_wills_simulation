# Blaseball Wills Election Simulator

This notebook prepares election tracker data and simulates wills draws, then creates plots to communicate the success of voting strategy and risk of wimdy for non-technical audiences.

Unabashedly hacky but hopefully not too messy. You will need to adapt to the structure of your team's vote tracking, but the sim is logically sound and the plots are pretty easy on the eyes.
